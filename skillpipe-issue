Skillpipe Materials
============================

 
Have a learner in your class that did not receive their Skillpipe materials before the class began? Rather than opening a support case for them, trainers should direct them to the ESI Support Portal (https://esisupport.microsoft.com), where they can open a support ticket (which should include the Delivery ID, class, and trainer name) on their own.
